            <span class="first-line">This is pretty basic.</span> I created this
            website from scratch to practice front-end development. After
            following a lot of devs on twitter and on YouTube, the consensus was
            that to really learn, I had to create my own project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was just watching other people on YouTube and copying their
            projects. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA" class="link-backs">(Thanks Brad Traversy!)</a> To be fair, I did pick up a lot of
            skill this way. It’s a great way to get started when you don’t know
            anything, but as time progressed, I got stuck in the dreaded
            “tutorial hell.” I struggled to create my own projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that it was where true learning lies - in the struggle. So far,
            I’ve fought with how to make this site responsive. I used a viewport
            height property on a section which looks fine on a laptop display
            but when you resize it, it gets wonky. I must come up with another
            solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            For now, I decided to focus on styling this blog post format. I’m
            going to keep it a simple as possible. There’s a fine line between
            getting out of the comfort zone and overwhelming myself with tasks
            I’m not ready for.
          </p>

            Other things: My random road image is to mark the phase of life I’m
            in. It’s a wanderlust, road less-travel phase which I had thought
            about blogging about, but I am puttin it on the back burner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next thing to attempt: Figure out a way to automate blog post
            entries formats with a content management system. Brad has a
            tutorial on this. He’s awesome. You should check him out if you like
            this stuff too.

            Dream: To get a second form of income working in tech in some small
            way remotely, so I can satisfy my wanderlust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Desire: To rightly align the gifts and talents bestowed upon me with
            God’s will and maximize them for His Kingdom.
